# rencbuild
A repo to develop a build process for REN-C

Even though there is a working build process for REN-C included in the sources, it is a complicated process that can do with a certain amount of refactoring.

This repo and Wiki are for developing such a process without getting in the way for people depending on different aspects of the current building process, like for example the Visual Studio build included.

The Wiki is for documenting and explaining how the new build process is implemented and to be used.

Please contribute.

Best Regards,

Arnold
